This folder contains the Mathematica notebooks and related material for https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15331
The notebooks are independent and need not be executed in order. They were created using Mathematica 13.
The code presupposes the existence of the folder 'Package' containing the BandUtilities Package in the parent directory.
BandUtilities need not be separately installed and the requires only the BandUtilities.wl file located inside 'Package'.

There are mostly no other additional requirements for the execution of the notebooks. 
However, if you wish to execute and run the C++ programs for ARPES best fit and Fermi surface calculation, ensure the following
1. A C++ compiler like g++ or clang++
2. LAPACK++ library installed
3. OpenMP and any additional requirements. 
Nevertheless the data generated by these programs is already contained in the cpp folder so all the Mathematica code in the notebooks can still be executed.
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
