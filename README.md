# Tuning higher order Van Hove singularities in Strontium Ruthenate (Sr<sub>2</sub>RuO<sub>4</sub>)
The folder **Sr2RuO4** contains the Mathematica notebooks and related material for https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15331
Most of the code is written in Wolfram Mathematica, with some parts written C++ (requires LAPACK++ and OpenMP).
The Wannierization of the DFT calculations was done by Luke Rhodes. The code requires my Mathematica Package, **BandUtilities**. This is contained in the folder **Package** along with some illustrative examples located in the folder **Examples**. 
Please reach out if you have any questions.
